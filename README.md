PotatOS
=======

An uLisp-based "Operating System" and text editor (named "typo") for my homebrew arduino based laptop.

The vast majority of the code here is from https://github.com/technoblogy/ulisp-arm with only slight modifications by me.

Some modifications / bug fixes to the SparkFun artemis platform and Adafruit GFX libaries are also required.
